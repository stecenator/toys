Useful perl toys
My perl toys reference
- lsrmt.pl - shows AIX and Linux (IBM Lintape) tapedrives in vrious ways. Useful with IBM Spectrum Protect and persistent names
- repl_kiler.pl - a script used to cancel replicate node TSM processess (as per for now, replicte node command has no duration attribute)

Generic modules for handling some aspects of OS and TSM:
- Gentools.pm
